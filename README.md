<h3> Dotfiles </h3>

My current set of Dotfiles.

This repository contains my Neovim, Alacritty and Sublime-Text config.
I will probably update this to have an install script in the future, to be able to switch my workflow around whenever necessary.

Neovim: <br>
I currently use Neovim v0.5, and I've replaced my old YouCompleteMe config with the built-in LSP config.
I have not set up tree-sitter so far, but I hope to do so with the release of v0.6.

Sublime Text: <br>
Vintage mode has been disabled.
My personal key bindings and user settings I use have been uploaded into this repository.
The theme I prefer is the agila theme and monokai colour scheme at the moment.
Finally, there's a couple of key binding changes, such as setting "ctrl+shift+]" as unindent.
Also, "ctrl+[" enters normal mode at the moment, although some day I hope use the Caps Lock button to do it instead.
