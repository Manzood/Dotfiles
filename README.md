<h3> Dotfiles </h3>

My current set of Dotfiles.

I'd say the most unique set of Dotfiles here are my Neovim Dotfiles, and I've tailored them to have a somewhat decent Competitive Programming experience.
There's probably a lot of changes I'll be making to it as I use Neovim as my primary editor now, especially with the release of Neovim 0.5.

Changes with respect to Sublime Text: <br>
Vintage mode has been disabled, and there are a bunch of plugins I could install.
My personal key bindings and user settings I use have been uploaded into this repository.
The theme I prefer is the agila theme and monokai colour scheme at the moment, though that probably isn't final.
Finally, there's a couple of key binding changes, such as setting "ctrl+shift+]" as unindent.
Also, "ctrl+[" enters normal mode at the moment, although some day I hope use the Caps Lock button to do it instead.
