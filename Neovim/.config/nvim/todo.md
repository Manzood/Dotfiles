# Upcoming things to work on
- Either remove plugins installed with packer, or switch to packer completely
- Set up nvim which-key? Maybe add a keybind that activates and deactivates it for usage only when I'm confused
- Switch back to vimwiki? It seemed to work, if set up properly
- Fix lspsasga hover\_doc:
    - Switch to other fork, or fix it yourself in your own fork and then forget about it
- Get a good indentline plugin
- Dashboard.nvim config - Maybe add Dashboard logo?
- Orgmode. I don't know exactly what it *can* do, but eventually, it should be able to replace all of this.
- Switch to Packer.nvim? It supports lazy loading and is probably going to be the primary plugin manager to use in the future

# Upcoming things to work on outside Neovim
Change zsh prompt to a (*good*) 2-line prompt, hopefully one that displays git branches and repos.
