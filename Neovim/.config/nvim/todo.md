# Upcoming things to work on
- Add comment.nvim
- Change the background of barbar.nvim for monokai pro
- Set up onedarkpro, properly. If set up correctly, it might be by new colosrcheme of choice
- Fix lspsasga hover\_doc:
    - Switch to other fork, or fix it yourself in your own fork and then forget about it
- Get a good indentline plugin
- Dashboard.nvim config
- Fix treesitter
- Better colorscheme, perhaps
- Fix bufferline background color to something more convenient
- Smooth scrolling?
- Try nvim-tree
- Orgmode. I don't know exactly what it *can* do, but eventually, it should be able to replace all of this.
- Switch to Packer.nvim? It supports lazy loading and is probably going to be the primary plugin manager to use in the future

# Upcoming things to work on outside Neovim
Change zsh prompt to a 2-line prompt, hopefully one that displays git branches and repos.
Maybe add something cool, like the time or battery percentage to the prompt.
